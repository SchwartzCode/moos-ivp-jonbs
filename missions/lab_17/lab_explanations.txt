4.3.1) The cooling factor has a positive correlation with the likelihood of
  good results (low error/good score) because higher cooling factors will
result in most of the distribution being concentrated at lower temperatures.
This results in less heating needed to be done in the annealing method to heat
the water to a random liquid-state arrangement, and therefore a quicker and
more accurate computational method.


Making the bounds for the alpha estimate wider will result in more variance in
results, as it allows for a greater range of estimates.

4.3.2) ((make it))

4.3.3) The accuracy of the two variables its estimating (wavelength and period)
 seem to be tied together; the estimates for each variable tend to be roughly
as close as the other estimate. The period estimates tend to be more accurate,
as the range allowed for period estimates is [100,300], whereas the range
allowed for wavelength estimates is [100,500]. A larger window for estimates
means more potential values for estimates, and therefore an increase in the
variance of the estimates.

4.3.4) The estimates tend to be more accurate when the angle is set to 270, but
  the estimates are more independent when the angle is set to 225.

  Smaller lane widths lead to longer search times and less accurate results
(likely due to lots of measurements from the same general area).
