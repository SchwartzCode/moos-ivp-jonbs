Just wanted to write down an observation from this mission

I noticed that my uuv never actually reaches the surface; its depth just
decreases for 60 seconds instead of pausing at the surface for 60 seconds. I'm
not sure if that's just how it is, or if I was supposed to scope for its depth
or something like that. 

Thats all, thanks for reading,
Jonathan
